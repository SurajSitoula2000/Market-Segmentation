The first step in market segmentation is deciding whether or not to segment. This involves assessing whether meaningful differences exist between customer groups and whether the organization has the resources and willingness to act on those differences. If segmentation is deemed beneficial, the second step is to specify what an ideal target segment should look like. This is done by setting clear criteria—such as size, accessibility, profitability and strategic fit—that guide the identification of valuable segments later in the process. The third step is collecting data, where the focus is on selecting relevant segmentation variables and gathering high-quality data through surveys, internal sources or other means. The fourth step involves exploring the data: cleaning it, checking for inconsistencies and performing descriptive analyses. Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) may be used to reduce dimensionality and visualize patterns in the data. In the fifth step, segments are extracted using methods such as k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering or model-based approaches like latent class analysis. It is important to evaluate different models and determine the optimal number of segments using criteria like AIC, BIC or cluster stability. Finally, in step six, the identified segments are profiled to understand their unique characteristics. This involves statistical comparisons and visualizations to make the segments meaningful, interpretable and actionable for decision-makers.
